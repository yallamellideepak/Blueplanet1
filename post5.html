<p>Our solar system has eight planets and Earth is one of the planet among these. All these planets revolve around the Sun in their own orbits. Each planet looks different when you see the satellite views of it. The planets not only are different from each in terms of composition &amp; size but it looks different from each other in terms of colors as well.</p>

<p><em>For example</em> – Mars looks red, Moon looks ashy grey, Saturn has a yellow appearance, Sun appears brilliant white and our Earth looks like a blue marble. The mother Earth is called a blue planet due to its blue color appearance from the outer surface but that’s not it, we will go through in detail Why Earth is called Blue Planet.</p>

<p>Most of us are curious to know why the Earth is called a blue planet. A general statement about the blue appearance of Earth from outer surface is that “The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.earthreminder.com/earth-day-tips-to-save-earth/">Earth</a>&nbsp;has almost 70% water on its surface due to which it looks blue in color”.</p>

<p>Well, if you look at the images of Earth, most of its part looks blue which are the oceans present on Earth’s surface, whereas some other part looks brown or green which is actually the continents and the poles of Earth looks like white caps due to ice.</p>

<p>However, the blue color of the planet may vary depending on the depth of the oceans. For example- If you take a look at the close picture of Earth’s surface, it looks like light blue color at the area around the continents, whereas the deep areas of oceans look deep blue in color.</p>

<p>Do you know that the ocean looks blue due to the reflection of the sky because the sky is blue in color? The sky appears blue in color because our atmosphere disperses blue light (which is of shorter-wavelength) quite efficiently as compared to red or orange light (which is of longer-wavelength). This is why the sky appears blue in the day time as blue light with shorter wavelength gets scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>In fact, if you click a picture inside water, it will appear completely bluish in color. For this reason, the oceans and seas appear blue in color, hence the <strong>Earth is called a blue planet</strong> because almost 3/4<sup>th</sup> of Earth’s surface is covered with oceans &amp; seas.</p>
