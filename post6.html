<p>Well, a common factor we already know that the Earth looks blue from outer space due to oceans. This is not the only factor that affects the color of the Earth’s surface but there are some other factors also that make the Earth appear like a blue dot. From outer space, the Earth looks like a blue ball. These are the factors that play an important role in the blue color of Earth- </p>

<h5><strong>Water content on Earth’s surface</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Earth has extremely hot red heat under its crust and the top outer surface is covered with water. The Earth’s surface has many oceans and seas starting from the Arctic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.earthreminder.com/marine-pollution-types-causes-effects-prevention/">Ocean</a>&nbsp;to the Southern Ocean.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These oceans &amp; seas cover almost 70% of Earth’s surface and the remaining 30% is covered with land. It means that almost 70% of Earth’s surface appears blue from outer space &amp; the leftover 30% looks greenish-brownish. This is the reason why Earth looks blue from outer space.</p>

<h5><strong>The color of the water content</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of now, we had known that the Earth appears blue from outer space but now we will discuss <em>why water is blue in color</em>. Water has the property of absorbing most of the colors of the light spectrum present in the Earth’s atmosphere.The oceanic water on Earth’s surface radiates blue in the spectrum that gives it the blue color. If the oceans have been radiating any other color (for example red) then the Earth’s surface would look alike that color like red. This is why the continents do not look blue for the same reason, it looks brown or green.</p>

<h5><strong>Dispersing in the ambiance</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The composition of Earth’s atmosphere mainly contains two gases- nitrogen &amp; oxygen. The molecules of these two gases present in the atmosphere absorb, disperse and radiate various lights. The lights with longer wavelengths such as red, yellow, orange etc. do not get affected much by the atmospheric gases &amp; does not get absorbed as well.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the blue light (with a shorter wavelength) gets absorbed and scattered by the atmospheric gases which create the blue sky we see daily. This blue light cannot be seen from outer space but plays an important role in the blue appearance of the Earth’s surface. Similarly, during the night the atmospheric gases could not connect with sunlight, hence the sky looks black in color.</p>

<h5><strong>Few other contradictions</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you look at the Earth’s surface from outer space it will look <a href="https://sciencing.com/earth-appear-blue-outer-space-12111369.html">blue</a> due to the presence of sunlight. On the other hand, if you are orbiting the Earth, it will appear black in some parts where it is experiencing night. The reason for appearing the Earth black is the absence of sunlight during the night, whereas during the night the stars look much brighter and the lands look dark blue due to artificial sources of lights.</p>
